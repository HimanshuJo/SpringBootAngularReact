1. Property '<property_name>' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.

	Initialize the Property:
		
		You can initialize the articles property in the constructor, or, if you're fetching data asynchronously. For example:

			articles: any[] = [];

	Definite Assignment Assertion Modifier:
		
		You can use the definite assignment assertion modifier (!) to tell TypeScript that you will ensure the property is assigned a value before it's used. For example:

			articles!: any[];
